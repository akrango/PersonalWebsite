                As a <b>Aromanian</b>, I grew up learning the aromanian language and identifying with the traditions that we nurture. If you are not familiar with the Aromanians, they
                are an ethnic group who speak an Eastern Romance language, native to the southern Balkans, in Southeast Europe traditionally living in central and southern Albania, south-western Bulgaria, northern and central Greece and North Macedonia.
                We are known by several other names, such as <b>"Vlachs"</b> or "Macedo-Romanians" in Romania.<br/>
                I want to share some important events and memories of my life that I have experienced as a Aromanian and maybe you can learn something about our culture.

                <h2>Aromanian National Day </h2>
                <hr/>
                <p>
                    The Aromanian National Day (Aromanian: <b>Dzua Natsionalã a Armãnjilor</b>) is the national day of the Aromanians.
                    As Aromanian associations and organizations declared in 1991, its day of observation is 23 May,
                    as this was the day in which it was announced that the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire Abdul Hamid II had recognized the Ullah Millet (<b>"Vlach Millet"</b>) for the Aromanians a day earlier on 22 May 1905.
                    The creation of the Ullah Millet  granted the Aromanians the right to have their own churches and to have more autonomy over education.<br/><br/>
                    Here is Macedonia we celebrate this day every year in the hotel "Alekasndar Palace". It usually starts with some songs sung or recited by children or a performance which is also done
                    by children who learn the language in their schools. The schools which offer this opportunity are located in Skopje, Shtip, Krusevo and Bitola.
                    I have also participated in these performances many times and it really has helped me be more relaxed when I have to speak to a large group of people.

                    The kids performance is followed by a more serious part which includes giving out plaques for those who have contributed for the group in the last year.
                    We still can enjoy song sung by different singing groups like "Gramosteanj" which also organises the event called "On St. Peter's Day all on the mountain".

                    The <b>"On St. Peter's Day all on the mountain"</b> festival is organised by the singing group <b>"Gramosteanj"</b> where aromanian groups from all over the Balkans and Macedonia come
                    to preform and sing old aromanian songs. In our family it is a tradition, so every year on the first weekend of july we visit Ponikva and watch my father preform
                    as one of the group members of "Gramosteanj".<br/>
                    It is really just an opportunity to catch up with close and distant relatives, have fun and learn some aromanian songs

                <p>
                    Everyone who attended the aromanian classes had the chance to go on a trip to Romania during the summer. It was a 7 day trip, usually to Sulina, which is a small
                    tourist town with lovely people. We made friends from all over Europe, partied at the beach, enjoyed the enormous beach waves,
                    watched the sunset, had art classes, competed in different sports, like basketball, football and many other activities.<br/>
                    It really was my favorite part of the summer and I am extremely happy to have been a part of such an unforgettable experience.
                    On the left there is a picture of my first ever trip to Romania, I was only 12 years old.
